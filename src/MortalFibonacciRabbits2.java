 * Problem
 * Recall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers from “Rabbits and Recurrence Relations”, 
 * which followed the recurrence relation Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2 and assumed that each pair of rabbits 
 * reaches maturity in one month and produces a single pair of offspring (one male, one female) 
 * each subsequent month.
 * Our aim is to somehow modify this recurrence relation to achieve a dynamic programming 
 * solution in the case that all rabbits die out after a fixed number of months. 
 * See Figure 4 for a depiction of a rabbit tree in which rabbits live for three months 
 * (meaning that they reproduce only twice before dying).
 * 
 * Given: Positive integers n≤100 and m≤20.
 * Return: The total number of pairs of rabbits that will remain after the n-th month 
 * if all rabbits live for m months.
 * Sample Dataset:   6 3
 * Sample Output:    4
